# Working with a Twelfth workspace

Twelfth is a commercial workspace for retail and category teams. The Twelfth MCP
server connects to **one** workspace, as the person who approved the connection,
with the read tools they chose on the consent screen.

## Start with context

1. Call `twelfth_get_workspace` first to learn which workspace is connected and
   what it has switched on. Name that workspace in your answer.
2. If `twelfth_get_preferences` is offered, read it before formatting money,
   dates or units, so the answer follows the workspace's own settings rather
   than a guess.
3. The tool list differs between workspaces and connections. Use what is
   offered. If a needed tool is missing, say which one and that it can be
   approved by reconnecting from **Settings → AI & agents** in Twelfth.

## Read carefully

- **Every tool is read-only.** Never say you changed, approved, assigned or
  deleted anything. When the user wants a change, tell them where to make it in
  the Twelfth app.
- **An empty result is not proof of absence.** It can mean the person lacks
  access to that part of the workspace (a category, remit or capability), or
  that a filter was too narrow. Say which you can't rule out, instead of saying
  "there are none".
- **One workspace only.** Don't speculate about other workspaces or other
  companies' data.
- Quote names, SKUs, dates and owners as returned. Don't invent people,
  products, prices or figures, and label any calculation you do yourself.

## Shape the answer

- Lead with the answer, then the evidence: which tool, which records.
- For actions, include the due date and assignee when present, and say when an
  action has no assignee.
- For pricing and stock, give the as-of time the tool returned. Competitor
  prices are last-seen observations, not live quotes.
